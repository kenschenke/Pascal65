# System Requirements

**Pascal65** system requirements vary a little based on the system you are running.

## Commodore 64/128

* A RAM expansion module is required.  The compiler, interpreter, and IDE consume the first 64k of memory.
* Two floppy drives.  The first floppy contains the Pascal65 program code and data files.  The second floppy drive is needed to save source files and compiled PRG files.
* A SDC2IEC is *highly* recommended.

## Mega65

* It is recommended that Pascal65 be run from an SD card image.
