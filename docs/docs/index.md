# Welcome to Pascal65

**Pascal65** is a [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal")
compiler and IDE for 6502-based Commodore
machines.  The [Mega65](https://mega65.org "Mega65") is currently supported. Support for the Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and Commander X16 will come at a later date.

## Major Components of Pascal65

### Compiler

First, and foremost, Pascal65 is a Pascal compiler.  It compiles Pascal source into
fully self-contained PRG files that can be distributed and run independently of Pascal65.

### IDE

Pascal65 also includes an integrated development environment.  The editor can edit multiple
open files, compile code, and even run the interpreter without leaving the IDE.
