# Sprites Library

The **Sprites** library contains procedures to define, enable, and manipulate
hardware sprites.

!!! note
    The **SpritePos** procedure can set a sprite's position on the screen.
    While it is possible to use this procedure to move a sprite, the
    **SpriteMove** library contains a procedure to animate a sprite
    along a straight path. The animation happens in the background
    while Pascal code continues to execute.
