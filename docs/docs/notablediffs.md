# Notable Differences

## Code Comments ##

Pascal65 supports single-line comments preceded by a double-slash, similar to many
C-like languages.  Multi-line comments begin with a open parenthesis and asterisk
and end with an asterisk followed by a close parenthesis.  *Pascal65 does not support
comments using curly braces since PETSCII does not contain the curly
brace characters.*
