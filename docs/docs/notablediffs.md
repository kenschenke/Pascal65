# Notable Differences

Pascal65 is not a complete implementation of the Pascal standard.  The following are
notable differences.

* No support for **real** (floating point)
* Sets are not implemented
* Pointers are missing
* There is no data type for strings.  String literals are implemented as arrays of characters.

## Future Wishes

Support for some of these features is planned for future releases.  Of note:

* Floating point support
* Pointers
* Add a data type for strings
