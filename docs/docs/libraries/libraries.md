# Libraries

Developers can create a library to be used by Pascal65 programs. A library
consists of two files that are used by the compiler. The first is an interface
file which describes the publicly accessible parts of the library such as
functions, procedures, declarations, and types. The implementation code for a
library is in an object file. The object file must be in a specific format and
will typically be written in assembly language.
