# Why Pascal?

You might be wondering why a Pascal compiler and interpreter.  Pascal was in its
heyday in the 1980s when the Commdore 64 and 128 were popular.  There were several
Pascal compilers made for the 64/128 and Pascal was even used to develop commercial
software, including early versions of Mac OS.

Pascal is a high-level structured language that is easier to learn and more
approachable than C and more powerful than BASIC.  As a structured language,
Pascal has support for reusable code in the form of procedures and functions,
variable scope, variable type safety, and user-defined data types such as
enumerations and records.

There are a few Pascal compilers that can cross-compile from a PC for these Commodore
machines.  Pascal65 has the advantage that development is done directly on the target
machine, much like it would have been in the 1980s.  For those looking for the 
maximum immersion, this is very era-appropriate.
